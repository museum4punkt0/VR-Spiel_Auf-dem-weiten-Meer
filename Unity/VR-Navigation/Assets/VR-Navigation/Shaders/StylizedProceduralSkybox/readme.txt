Who: Created by: "DMeville" (@DMeville on twitter)

What: Procedural stylized skybox.  Wanted something that was similiar to unity's default procedural skybox, but in nodes.
This isn't physically correct, nor does it do any atmospheric scattering or anything, but all the colours are customizable which I think can lead to faked scattering pretty well. Or at least a stylized alternative.
Needs to be hooked up to a time of day system to change the colors automatically for extra cool.

Will probably have clouds eventually.
